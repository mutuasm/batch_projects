batch_projects/erp_triggers.py
───────────────────────────────
closes the one-way street: automations could WRITE to ERPNext
("Update ERPNext Document") but never HEAR from it. These doc_events fire
`erp.*` events onto the SAME bus every task/comment/schedule trigger already
rides (`events.emit()`) so automations/notifications/realtime pick them up
for free — no parallel dispatch mechanism.

Tenancy is the whole security model here: an ERPNext doc that doesn't
resolve to a BP Project is a silent no-op, never an error, never a chance to
leak into an unrelated project's rules. Resolution reuses erp_link.py's own
`_tenant_ok` verbatim rather than re-deriving a second, subtly different
check (see erp_link.py module docstring for why that boundary is sacred).

# ─── Generic doc-event trigger ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The 4 handlers below this block are hand-wired to one specific ERPNext
# doctype each — real, but narrow: any doctype not on that list (Purchase
# Order, Quotation, a customer's own custom doctype, anything) had no path
# onto the automation event bus at all. `on_any_doctype_event` widens this
# via a "*" wildcard doc_events hook (hooks.py) instead of hand-wiring more
# doctypes one at a time.
#
# Two deliberate boundaries, matching how workspace-vs-project scope already
# works everywhere else in this app:
#   - WORKSPACE-scope rules can match ANY doctype's lifecycle event — no
#     project resolution needed (payload carries project=None, same as an
#     external.webhook event — see run_for_event's project=None handling).
#     This is the intended extension point: "when anything of type
#     X happens anywhere, do Y."
#   - PROJECT-scope rules only apply to the 4 hand-wired doctypes above,
#     which already know how to resolve a BP Project via _tenant_ok. Generic
#     project resolution for an ARBITRARY doctype (which field even points
#     at a project?) is a per-doctype problem this hook doesn't try to solve
#     — a project-scoped automation for a 5th ERPNext doctype still wants a
#     purpose-built handler like the ones below, not a guess.
#
# Performance: this fires on every after_insert/on_update/on_submit/
# on_cancel/on_trash for EVERY doctype site-wide. _any_doc_event_rules_exist
# is a single short-TTL cached boolean — the overwhelming common case (zero
# erp.doc_event rules configured) costs one cache read and returns, no DB
# query, no event build, no condition evaluation.

# richer event emission — this would just be noisy duplication) or for a
