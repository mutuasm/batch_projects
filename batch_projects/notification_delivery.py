"""Final authorization boundary for task-backed notification delivery.

Recipient selection is advisory. Watcher rows, mentions, notification rules and
automations can all become stale after membership changes, assignment removal or
a project move. Every delivery channel must therefore re-check the durable task
and the recipient's *current* access immediately before exposing task metadata.

This module intentionally knows nothing about notification preferences or
routing. It answers one question only: may this identity receive information
about this task/project right now?
