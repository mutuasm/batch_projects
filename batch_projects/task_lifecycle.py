"""Authoritative soft-trash / restore lifecycle for BP Task.

Soft deletion changes live visibility and the gateway authorization graph, so it
cannot remain a raw ``is_deleted`` flag flip. These endpoints are wired through
``override_whitelisted_methods`` and keep MariaDB, realtime clients, automation,
notification rules, Redis and OpenFGA aligned.

Cascade provenance uses one shared ``deleted_on`` timestamp for the parent and
only the descendants deleted by that same operation. Restore therefore never
resurrects a child that had already been independently trashed.
