BP Automation Rule
──────────────────
A "When → If → Then" rule — the recipe/trigger-action shape enterprise
automation tools converge on — v2: workspace scope + ordered
multi-action list + richer triggers.

    WHEN  a trigger event fires                    (trigger_event + trigger_config)
    IF    the conditions match the task             (conditions)
    THEN  run the actions, IN ORDER                  (actions = [{type, config}, ...])

Scope:
    project    (default) — fires only for its own `project`. Project-Admin bar.
    workspace  — fires for every project, or the ones listed in `project_filter`
                 (empty = all). Workspace-admin only. `project_filter` is
                 checked BEFORE condition evaluation (cheap reject) — both here
                 and in the Go gateway engine.

The engine entry point is `run_for_event(event_name, payload)`, called from
`batch_projects.events.emit()` for every mutation. Rules never break the
mutation that triggered them — every rule runs in its own try/except, and
every ACTION within a rule runs in ITS OWN try/except too (`_run_actions`):
one failing action logs its own `BP Automation Run` row (with `action_index`)
and the loop continues — it never aborts the rest of the rule.

─── conditions JSON ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Either a bare list (all clauses ANDed):

    [ {"field": "priority", "op": "eq", "value": "Highest"} ]

…or an object with "all" / "any" groups:

    {"all": [ ... ], "any": [ ... ]}

A clause is {"field", "op", "value"}. Resolvable fields are any BP Task field
(status, priority, task_type, story_points, due_date, billable …) plus the
synthetic fields: to_status, from_status (status_changed events) and event.
The "labels" and "assignees" fields resolve to lists; "cf:<id>" reads a
custom field value.

Operators: eq ne in nin gt gte lt lte contains changed is_set is_not_set
  - changed: true when the field is in this event's changed-set (value ignored)
  - contains: substring (strings) or membership (lists)

THIS MATCHER (`_match` / `_match_clause` / `_resolve`) IS FINISHED — v2 adds
NO new op and no new resolvable synthetic field. The two new trigger types
below (`task.field_changed`, `task.moved_sprint`) are NOT new bus events; they
compile to a pre-check read directly off the event payload's own `changes`
list (`_compiled_trigger_matches`, using the exact same "is this field in the
changed-set" / "does it equal this value" building blocks as the `changed`/
`eq` ops — just evaluated ahead of, not inside, `_match_clause`, since a
"from" comparison for an arbitrary field has no home in `_resolve` today).
The rule's own (user-authored) `conditions` still apply on top, unchanged.

─── trigger_config JSON (only for task.field_changed / schedule.relative) ────
task.field_changed : {"field": "priority", "from": "Low", "to": "High"}
                     ("from"/"to" optional — bare "field" alone fires on ANY
                     change to that field, mirroring the "changed" op)
schedule.relative  : {"field": "due_date", "offset_days": 3, "direction":
                     "before"|"after"} — generalizes task.due_soon to any
                     date field. Registered as a fixed daily poll on the
                     bridge scheduler (interval_seconds auto-set to 86400);
                     when its own timer fires, `_run_relative_schedule` scans
                     for tasks whose `field` lands on today ± offset_days
                     across the rule's project (or project_filter/workspace).

─── actions JSON ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ordered list: [{"type": <Action Type>, "config": {...}}, ...], run in sequence.
Same action bodies as before, just addressed by `action["type"]`/
`action["config"]` instead of the old single `rule.action_type`/
`rule.action_config` pair (kept, hidden+read-only, for one release —
`_get_actions` falls back to them for any not-yet-migrated row):

Change Status : {"status": "Done"}
Assign Issue  : {"assignees": ["a@x.com", ...], "mode": "set"|"add"}  (default set)
Notify        : {"to": "assignees"|"watchers"|"reporter", "users": [...],
                 "message": "..."}
Create Issue  : {"title": "...", "task_type": "Task", "status": "...",
                 "priority": "Medium", "assignees": [...],
                 "link_to_trigger": true}   (link type "relates to")
Update ERPNext Document : {"doctype": "Sales Invoice"|"Sales Order"|"Timesheet"|"ToDo",
                 "name_from": "fixed"|"task_field"|"cf:<id>", "name": "...",
                 "field": <task fieldname, when name_from="task_field">,
                 "fields": {fieldname: value, ...}}
                 Gateway-engine only — see _ERPNEXT_DOCTYPE_WHITELIST.

    substitute, same reasoning bp-gateway's own resolveTemplate() already
    uses for message_template fields: this text is user-authored automation
    config, not developer-authored code.

    `task.<field>` reads the triggering task — rendered as "" when the field
    is a REAL field left blank (the author explicitly referenced it, an
    empty value is a legitimate render), but left VERBATIM when the field
    doesn't exist on the doctype at all (task.meta.has_field — a plain
    `task.get()` returns None for both cases, which would otherwise silently
    swallow a typo'd token instead of surfacing it). Anything else is looked
    up in the raw event payload. A token that can't be resolved at all
    (task.* with no task in context, or a payload key that doesn't exist) is
    also left verbatim — so a rule saved before this existed, or one that
    happens to contain literal `{{` text unrelated to this feature, renders
    exactly as before. Fast no-op for the vast majority of existing saved
