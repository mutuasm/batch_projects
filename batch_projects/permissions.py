"""
batch_projects/permissions.py
─────────────────────────────
Data-layer access control for BP doctypes — the safety net beneath board.py.

board.py's whitelisted endpoints enforce project roles, but they mostly use
frappe.get_all (which ignores user permissions). Anyone hitting the generic
REST API (/api/resource/BP Task) or a report would otherwise bypass all of
it. These hooks close that gap and, in doing so, finally make the project
`visibility` field mean something:

    workspace  — visible to every System User (the default; preserves today's
                 open behavior so existing all-workspace installs don't change)
    team       — visible to members of the project's BP Team (+ project members)
    private    — visible only to explicit BP Project Members

System Managers (and Administrator) see everything.

Wired in hooks.py via `permission_query_conditions` (list/report/REST filtering)
and `has_permission` (single-document gate).

# "you see the projects you are a member of". Native Project and Task are
# shared with the rest of the site, so applying that rule to them directly
# would have consequences the BP doctypes never had:
#
#   * `Task` is readable today by `Projects User` and `HR Manager`, and HRMS
#     reads it for timesheet/leave flows. `Project` is readable by `Desk User`,
#     `Projects Manager` and `Projects User`. A blanket membership filter hides
#     every row from all of them.
#
#   * Scoping per *user* is not enough either. If a Projects Manager is added
#     to a single BP project, a user-level rule would suddenly hide every other
#     project on the site from them — punishing them for joining one project.
#
# So the fallback is per *project*, not just per user: a project is only scoped
# by membership once it is actually BP-managed, which `custom_visibility`
# records (BP-created projects set it; a plain ERPNext project leaves it
# empty). Everything else keeps stock ERPNext behaviour.
#
# NOT wired into hooks yet — see the module's stage-3 notes. Activating these
# changes site-wide access, so it lands with the rest of stage 3 rather than
# ahead of it.
