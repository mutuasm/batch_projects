Cross-origin bridge bootstrap.

On Frappe Cloud the SPA is served from the FC origin while the bp-gateway runs on
a different origin, so the httpOnly `sid` cookie can't reach the bridge. This
endpoint — called same-origin by the logged-in SPA — mints a short-lived bearer
the SPA hands to the bridge's /v1/session/bootstrap. The bridge verifies it
locally against the shared secret (no callback) and issues its own session JWT.

The token is an HS256 JWS signed with `bp_bridge_bootstrap_secret` (site_config),
which MUST equal the gateway's `auth.bootstrap_secret`. We hand-roll the compact
JWS with hmac/base64 so there is no dependency on PyJWT being installed — keeping
to the "two artifacts only" rule (no extra packages).

Security: this is NOT allow_guest. A real logged-in Frappe session is required —
that session is the authorization. The minted token only ever carries the
caller's own identity (no privilege escalation), is valid ~120s, and is scoped by
`purpose:"bootstrap"` so the gateway only accepts it to start a session.
