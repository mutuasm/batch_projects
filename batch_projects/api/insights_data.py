───────────────────────────────────
Raw row feeds for the gateway's compute plane.

This module is deliberately arithmetic-free. It answers "which rows is this
user allowed to see, and what is in them" — nothing else. Every derived
number (labour cost, margin, margin %, budget utilisation, rollup totals) is
computed in bp-gateway's internal/insights package, in the compiled binary.

Why the split, and why the math is NOT here:
    batch_projects is the open, self-hostable half of an open-core product.
    A `require_feature("profitability")` check in front of a margin formula
    gates ACCESS to the formula while shipping the formula itself in the same
    public repo — a self-hoster deletes two lines and keeps the feature. The
    formula is the part customers pay for, so the formula is the part that
    lives in the binary. Frappe stays the data hub: it owns the schema, the
    permission model, and the rows. The gateway owns the analysis.

    This is the same decide-vs-write split the automation engine already
    uses (Go evaluates, Frappe executes) pointed the other way: Frappe reads,
    Go computes.

Caller contract:
    Service account ONLY (_assert_service_caller). These endpoints take the
    acting `user` as a parameter rather than reading frappe.session.user,
    because the gateway calls them with its own service credentials on behalf
    of a user its session middleware already authenticated — the same trust
    shape internal/billing uses when it forwards X-BP-User-Email to
    bp-license. The service-caller assertion is what makes that parameter
    safe: without it, an arbitrary `user=` would be a privilege-escalation
    surface, since these rows are financial.

    No require_feature() call here on purpose. Tier enforcement for these
    surfaces happens at the gateway, before Frappe is ever reached — see
    internal/license/license.go's urlToFeature and internal/insights'
    own Allows() check. Re-checking in Python would be the patchable gate
    this module exists to stop relying on.
