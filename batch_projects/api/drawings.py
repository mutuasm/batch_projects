─────────────────────────────────
BP Drawing — project-level Excalidraw whiteboards. Multiple
drawings per project: a light list, then a full scene per drawing.

Gating is TWO independent layers (both must pass, same contract Notes/Gantt
use): the workspace feature flag "draw" (admin kill switch) AND the
Team+ tier gate (this is a paid surface, unlike Notes). Permission is
project-role based, delegating entirely to access.py (read-only import,
never modified here):
  read = Viewer+, create/save = Member+, delete = Manager+ (delete is the one
  destructive action here, so it gets access.py's own "delete" ptype floor —
  see access.py's _PTYPE_MIN_ROLE — rather than a bespoke rule).

No per-drawing authorship gate — a whiteboard is a shared, continuously-edited
surface, not an authored note; anyone who can write can edit anyone's scene.

Conflict policy: last-write-wins + a stale-load warning. The caller sends the
`modified` timestamp it loaded the doc with; if the doc has moved on since,
the save still goes through (never blocks a save) but the response carries
`stale: true` so the frontend can tell the user someone else's change was
just overwritten.

# above remains the sole durable write path, on its own 2s debounce) ─────────
#
# Was entirely absent: this module had autosave and a "stale — you just
# overwrote someone else's change" warning (see save_drawing's docstring),
# but nothing broadcast a change AS it happened, and nothing showed who else
# had a drawing open — every "collaborative" whiteboard was single-player
# until the next full reload. These two endpoints, paired with DrawCanvas.
# vue's onRealtimeEvent subscription and Excalidraw's own reconcileElements
# (version-based merge, the same utility their official collaboration
# example uses), are what actually makes it live.
