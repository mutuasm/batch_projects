"""Frappe → bp-gateway client (the scheduler/automation side-car).

The Go agent owns durable timers (recurring automations, SLA timers, deferred
actions) because Frappe's synchronous workers can't. When a user saves a
scheduled rule we *register* a job with the agent; when the rule's time comes
the agent calls back into ``batch_projects.api.automation.run_scheduled_event``
and Frappe does the transactional work. This module is only the outbound
registration half.

Config (site_config.json / env, never hard-coded):
    bp_bridge_url               e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:8001" — used here AND
                                 injected into every page as
                                 window.__BP_BRIDGE_URL__ for the browser's
                                 own /v1/* calls (see api/gateway.py).
    bp_bridge_internal_url      optional override, THIS module only. Exists
                                 because a browser and this backend process
                                 don't always reach the gateway at the same
                                 address — e.g. a docker-compose dev topology
                                 where the gateway sits behind a Caddy
                                 container only reachable from the host at
                                 127.0.0.1:8080, but that address is the
                                 *backend container's own loopback* from in
                                 here (confirmed live 2026-08-05:
                                 publish_event()/publish_realtime_event() were
                                 silently failing — connection refused — for
                                 exactly this reason, even though the same
                                 URL works fine for the browser). Falls back
                                 to bp_bridge_url when unset, so every normal
                                 single-address deployment (self-hosted
                                 install.sh, Frappe Cloud) is unaffected.
    bp_scheduler_ingest_token   shared token == gateway scheduler.ingest_token

If either is unset the functions are no-ops (dev without a bridge still saves
rules cleanly) — registration just won't happen, logged once at debug.

    Was frappe.publish_realtime() — Frappe's own native socket.io/pub-sub
    mechanism, which this gateway's Subscribe() never consumed: two
    completely disconnected systems. Confirmed live (2026-08-05): a

    valid session token, correct CORS, and a genuinely open stream — every
    realtime-dependent feature in the app (board live-refresh, drawing
    collaboration, notification badge) was silently non-functional in any
    topology where the gateway is a separate origin from Frappe. This is the
    fix: publish through the gateway's own plane instead.

    Deliberately NOT /v1/events (automation ingest) despite both ultimately
    feeding Gateway-owned Redis transports — that endpoint writes to the
    durable automation Stream and gates on the "automations" feature; see
    realtime.go's Publish doc comment for why reusing it would be wrong for
    a plane that can fire many times a second under active use (drawing
