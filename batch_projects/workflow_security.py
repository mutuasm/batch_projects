"""Authorization boundary for BP Workflow (the graph-canvas automation
surface) — the workflow-graph counterpart of automation_security.py.

BP Workflow's action nodes reuse bp_automation_rule._execute() UNCHANGED
(api/automation.py's own docstring: "zero new code") — a node's {type,
config} is exactly the same action-dict shape a BP Automation Rule action
already carries. automation_security.py's per-action-type authority checks
(ERP-mutation scope, outbound token/money-field restriction, assignee
validity, task/project dispatch-scope matching) are therefore reused
directly here rather than reimplemented — a BP Workflow document exposes
the same .scope/.project/.get("project_filter") shape validate_rule_authority
and validate_dispatch already operate on.

Two independent problems, two independent fixes:
  - list_workflows/test_workflow (api/workflows.py, the frontend CRUD
    surface) had their own bugs — an unsafe OR-filter cross-project leak and
    a confused-deputy test-fire — unrelated to the action-authority gap
    below. Fixed by list_workflows/test_workflow here.
  - Nothing validated a workflow's own action nodes at all, at save time or
    execution time, the way automation_security.py does for BP Automation
    Rule. Closed by validate_workflow_authority (doc_events validate) and
    validate_workflow_dispatch (execution-time re-check), both below.
