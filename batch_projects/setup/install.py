    Idempotent — called from after_install AND from the
    create_bp_task_accounting_dimension patch, because on a fresh install
    Frappe marks all patches as already-executed without running them
    (set_all_patches_as_completed), so a patch alone would skip new sites.

    fieldname MUST be "bp_task" (= frappe.scrub("BP Task")): ERPNext's
    validate_company_in_accounting_dimension reads dimension values via
    scrub(document_type), not the registered fieldname, so any other name
    would silently bypass that validation path.

    Registering the dimension stamps `bp_task` onto all 56 doctypes ERPNext+
    HRMS list under accounting_dimension_doctypes — that's a side effect of
    reusing ERPNext's own mechanism, not 56 deliberate integration points.
    Only Purchase Invoice Item/Purchase Order Item are actually read
    anywhere (api/erp_link.py's materials cost) — Stock Entry/Stock Ledger
    Entry/GL Entry etc. carry the field but nothing in this app reads it,
    zero live usage today. Deliberately not
    wired further: no current template/customer signal for physical stock-
    consumption costing, and it's a large build for that thin a signal.
