"""Last-mile authorization for BP Task email.

frappe.email.queue.flush() (Frappe core) is the actual SMTP delivery
boundary — it runs independently of and in unpredictable order relative to
any BatchProjects scheduled job (Frappe v15 shuffles "all"-cadence jobs and
enqueues each independently), so a separate recheck job can never reliably
run "immediately before" delivery. The only point that IS immediately before
delivery is EmailQueue.send() itself.

Scoped via hooks.py's override_doctype_class to Email Queue only — every
other email on the site (ERPNext, HR, core Frappe) goes through this same
subclass but is a plain no-op passthrough for anything not referencing a
BP Task, so its behavior is unchanged.
