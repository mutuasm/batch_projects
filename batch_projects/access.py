"""
batch_projects/access.py
────────────────────────
THE single source of truth for "what can this user do on this project".

Before this module there were three uncoordinated authorization systems:

  1. board.py `_check_permission`  — project roles (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer)
  2. doctype JSON `permissions`   — Frappe roles (Projects User/Manager …)
  3. permissions.py visibility    — workspace / team / private

…and which one fired depended on whether an endpoint happened to call
`doc.save()` (→ doctype gate) or `frappe.db.set_value()` (→ no gate). Same
user, same board, different verdict. That is the bug this module removes.

Everything now resolves through `get_effective_role()`:

  • Administrator / System Manager            → Admin   (instance superuser)
  • explicit BP Project Member.role           → that role
  • non-member System User, project is …
        workspace                             → Viewer  (can see, can't edit)
        team   AND user in the project's team → Viewer
        private                               → None    (no access)
  • non System User (Website/Guest)           → None

Capabilities are derived from the role rank, never from the call path:

        VIEW  ≥ Viewer      COMMENT ≥ Member
        EDIT  ≥ Member      MANAGE  ≥ Manager
        ADMIN ≥ Admin

Both the API layer (board.py `_check_permission`) and the data layer
(permissions.py `has_permission` / query conditions) call into here, so the
generic REST API, reports, list views and the SPA all enforce the same rule.

# Representation choice: capability -> {min_role, ...} (a monotonic threshold),
# not a bare per-role boolean matrix, because it maps directly onto the
# existing rank-based model (VIEW>=Viewer, COMMENT/EDIT>=Member, MANAGE>=
# Manager, ADMIN>=Admin per the module docstring) — one field expresses the
# same thing has_at_least()/require() already compute from ROLE_RANK, instead
# of spelling out 4 redundant booleans per capability. The RESOLVED matrix
# (what get_capability_matrix() returns) IS a per-role boolean grid, because
# that's what a role override actually needs to express: "Member is normally
# >= Viewer's view_money default, but this workspace switched it off for
# Member specifically" is not a single threshold anymore once overridden.
#

# picture (Projects/Tasks/Boards/Members context) — but they are NOT
# independently enforced anywhere; they simply mirror ROLE_RANK. Making them
# independently toggleable would mean every access.require(...) call site in
# the app switching from its own hardcoded min-role string to a registry
# lookup — a much larger refactor that would risk altering existing
# semantics. Only view_money/view_files are real, enforced, overridable
