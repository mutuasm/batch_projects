# Contributing to BatchProjects

BatchProjects is maintained as production software for the ERPNext ecosystem. Contributions are welcome, but changes must be reviewable, testable, and safe to operate.

## Before you start

- Use the structured GitHub issue forms for bugs, regressions, features, and engineering work.
- Security vulnerabilities are **never** reported through public issues; follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- Read [`docs/engineering/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/engineering/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) and [`docs/engineering/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](docs/engineering/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) before non-trivial changes.
- Architecture decisions that affect trust boundaries, money, compatibility, migrations, or Community/Gateway ownership belong in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/).

## How changes land

The v16 line uses an integration branch and a stable release branch:

`short-lived branch -> develop-16 -> tested release PR -> version-16`

Normal product, engineering, dependency, and maintenance changes start from `develop-16`, land there through a pull request, and reach `version-16` only as part of an explicitly tested release candidate.

The expected flow is:

1. Start from the current `develop-16` branch.
2. Create a short-lived branch for one concern.
3. Implement the smallest coherent change.
4. Add or update regression coverage.
5. Run the relevant checks locally.
6. Open a pull request targeting `develop-16` and complete the full PR template.
7. Address review and CI findings.
8. Merge only after required checks and review are satisfied.
9. Promote a tested release candidate from `develop-16` to `version-16` through a release PR; do not push accumulated development work directly to stable.

A production hotfix is the exception: branch from `version-16`, merge the minimal verified fix back to `version-16` through a PR, then immediately forward-port the same fix to `develop-16` through its own reviewed PR. Stable-only fixes must not be allowed to drift indefinitely.

Do not bundle unrelated cleanup into a product change. Smaller PRs are easier to reason about, safer to revert, and produce more useful repository history.

## Branch model

- `version-16` is the stable/default v16 release line.
- `develop-16` is the v16 integration line and the normal base/target for short-lived development branches.
- Short-lived branches describe one concern and are deleted after merge.
- Stable promotion is a deliberate release operation from a tested `develop-16` release candidate, not an ad-hoc direct push.
- Hotfixes start from stable and must be forward-ported to development immediately after the stable fix lands.
- Dependabot version-update pull requests target `develop-16`. GitHub security-update pull requests target the default branch (`version-16`); those fixes follow the hotfix/forward-port rule above.

Short-lived implementation branches should describe intent, for example:

- `fix/381-zero-billing-hours`
- `sec/417-gateway-ssrf`
- `feat/402-resource-calendar`
- `refactor/455-board-service`
- `chore/470-ci-frappe-tests`

See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for BatchProjects/Gateway/ERPNext compatibility.

## Development setup

BatchProjects is a Frappe app plus a Vue 3 / Vite SPA.

Frappe/ERPNext v16 require **Python 3.14+** and **Node 24+**; the CI matrix
pins exactly those.

```bash
# Install the current stable release line inside an existing bench
bench get-app https://github.com/BatchNepal/batch_projects --branch version-16
bench --site yoursite.local install-app batch_projects

# Frontend
cd apps/batch_projects/frontend
NODE_ENV=development yarn install --production=false
yarn dev
yarn build
```

`bench build` does **not** rebuild the standalone Vite SPA. After frontend source changes, run `yarn build` and commit the resulting `batch_projects/public/frontend/` output in the same PR.

## Testing expectations

At minimum, test the behaviour you changed and its failure path. Higher-risk areas require stronger evidence:

- permissions/tenancy: prove denied access as well as allowed access;
- billing/accounting: test zero/null semantics, currency, lifecycle, and duplicate execution where relevant;
- migrations/schema: test fresh install and upgrade behaviour;
- Gateway contracts: test incompatible/missing Gateway behaviour and fail-closed enforcement;
- UI: cover loading, empty, error, permission, and disabled states where the change affects them.

Frappe integration tests can be run with `bench run-tests --app batch_projects` or a narrower module while developing.

## Frontend conventions

Use the existing `@/ui` component kit and token system. Do not add a second component library or introduce page-local visual conventions when an existing primitive covers the interaction. Visible UI changes should include screenshots or a short recording in the PR.

## Code and architecture conventions

- Prefer domain-focused modules over adding unrelated responsibilities to large API modules.
- Low-level helpers should not decide transaction boundaries unless that ownership is intentional and documented.
- `ignore_permissions=True` requires an explicit, server-side authorization boundary before it is used.
- Financial logic must preserve value units and ERPNext's role as accounting source of truth.
- Premium capability should follow [`ADR-001`](docs/architecture/ADR-001-open-core-boundary.md); a removable public-code conditional is not sufficient protection for valuable executable capability that can live in Gateway.
- Do not reference private/non-shipped planning files as the sole explanation for public architecture.

## Pull request review

The reviewer is expected to understand why the change exists, what invariant it affects, what can fail, and how it is tested. The PR template intentionally asks for security, financial, migration, compatibility, and rollback impact so those questions are answered before merge instead of after an incident.
